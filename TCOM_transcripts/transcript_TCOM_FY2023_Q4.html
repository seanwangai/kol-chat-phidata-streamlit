With that I&#x27;ll turn the call over to Jane, for operational highlights.\nJane Sun: Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone. As a quick overview, our net revenue in Q4 grew by 104% year-over-year and increased by 24% compared to 2019. During this period, the travel industry witnessed a strong momentum. As rising travel sentiment drove growth and supply side constraints continued to ease. Both, our hotel and air reservations grew by approximately 130% year-over-year. For the full year of 2023, our total net revenue achieved year-over-year growth of 122% and 25% compared to 2019. This outstanding result was due to the robust release of travel demand and the exceptional performance across all of our business segments.  Additionally, our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2023 significantly improved to 31%, reflecting the successful optimization of our cost structure and overall productivity enhancement.  Now let me walk you through different market performance. First, China Domestic. In Q4, the China domestic market continued to exhibit robust growth. Our domestic hotel bookings witnessed a year-over-year growth of over 130% or more than 60% compared to 2019.  Demand for travel showed no signs of slowing down during the winter season. Popular destinations such as Harbin in the northern part of the country, experienced a surge in visitors. Notably, individuals have been prioritizing travel expenditures over other daily expenses, indicating a shift towards experiential spending. This change in consumer behavior has significantly favored travel industry as more people allocate their resources towards exploring new places and creating memorable experiences.  We have continued to expand our user base among the elderly demographics through the deep integration of product integration, content generation and marketing efforts. In Q4, the number of the users over 50 years old, increased by more than 90% compared to 2019. And this is just a beginning to capitalize on the market opportunity for retired community, which has been in power and ample time.  Second, outbound market. Despite the winter seasonality in Q4, outbound travel from China, maintain the same level of the recovery as the peak season in Q3. The gradual easing of supply side constraints, such as increased international flight capacity, and certain clearance of the Visa block, played a significant role in facilitating this positive trend. Chinese travelers continue to exhibit high demand for travel to overseas destinations. Moreover, many countries implemented visa free policies, specifically targeting at Chinese travelers, further enhancing the appeal of these destinations and securing their popularities.  In Q4, Trip.com Group\u2019s outbound air ticket and hotel bookings recovered to more than 80% of pre-pandemic level, surpassing the market overall recovery rate of 60%. Thailand, Singapore, Japan, Korea, Malaysia remain as the top outbound travel destination on our platform.  Third, global markets. On the international front, we actively enhance our global market presence. Through the strong synergy of improved products, enhance the services and targeted marketing efforts, we have witnessed a steady growth in APAC region. In Q4, total GMV of our overseas OTA brand grew by more than 70% year-over-year, and increased by more than one 100% compared to 2019.  Now, let me walk you through a few strategic highlights. First, globalization. As 2023 was about a return to travel, then 2024 will be the year when people go further than ever before. The travelers become more comfortable and confident then touring around the world. They are taking to the skies, rails, roads and the seas to experience unforgettable adventures. From music festivals to exotic adventures, travelers are increasingly seeking more than just a typical gateway.

We have been successful in gaining mindshare and market share in the key Asia regions, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, Japan, Thailand and Malaysia. Second, inbound markets. China inbound travel is an untapped opportunity. Inbound tourism plays a vital role in country&#x27;s economy.  For tourism dependent countries, such as Thailand, inbound travel can contribute to more than 10% of its GDP. For developed nation, inbound travel can contribute to around 1% to 3% of its GDP. China&#x27;s current level is less than 0.5%. If China can reach a global average, between 1% to 2%, it would unlock a great market potential of another RMB1.5 trillion to RMB2 trillion market.  Recognizing the importance of inbound travel, China has included its integral part of its 14th five-year plan. The government has taken steps to facilitate inbound tourism by granting visa free access, making travel more convenient for international visitors. China has extended its visa free policies to citizens from 10 countries so far, including France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, Switzerland, Singapore, and Malaysia and Thailand. Since the implementation of this visa free policy, there have been a remarkable increase in inbound travel to China from these countries, with a rising of nearly 30% in December when compared to November, as reported by Chinese National Immigration administration.  In 2023, Trip.com, has already observed a significant surge in visitor numbers, with a four-digit increase compared to 2022. Moreover, government is making progress in many areas, such as simplifying visa application process, facilitating foreign credit card payments, and enabling online travel reservations with foreign passports. We anticipate that the forthcoming inbound tourism policy will bring about favorable changes, creating new opportunities for the industry. With Trip.com Groups, extensive customer reach and a robust supply chain, we are well prepared to capitalize on the future growth of inbound travel.  Third, AI, the integration of artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformational force, revolutionizing the way we experience and navigate the world.

With that operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joyce Ju, from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJoyce Ju: Good morning James, Jane and Cindy, congrats on those strong results and thanks for taking my question. This quarter, the company&#x27;s international platform Trip.com actually saw another robust quarter and the management also mentioned a lot in your opening remarks, that the globalization is actually our important, like, long term goal. Could you kindly elaborate a little bit more on this front? What&#x27;s the Trip.com\u2019s current achievement, more details any color what we find? And the near term midterm even longer term goals and also their consequence, like, strategies to achieve that. How would your digital strategy help to reach this goal? Thanks a lot.\nJames Liang: Thank you very much for the question. Our digital strategy focuses on globalization and a great quality. We believe our long term growth relies on the progression of our globalization strategy, which aims to build global products supply chains, services and technology for our worldwide users. Asia is a top travel destination for travelers from China and other parts of the region. By leveraging our strong supply chain, diverse product offering an industry leading service and technology, we strive to provide exceptional service for users in Asia and subsequently around the world.  With respect to great quality, our mission is to provide the best travel experience with the best technology. For example, we have introduced TripGenie, an AI based travel assistant, to enhance the travel planning experience. We&#x27;re also using AI to improve the efficiency of our customer service, content generation and IT operations. Thank you\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from line of Alex Poon from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nAlex Poon : Good morning. Congratulation management for very strong quarter. My question is regarding our recent business performance, particularly around Chinese New Year, and after four different segments, including domestic, outbound and Trip.com. And how should we elaborate or extrapolate from this strong CMI [ph] performance into Q1 and the rest of the year? Thank you so much.\nJane Sun : Thank you, Alex. As of 2023, our business has fully rebounded to pre-COVID levels. From this year forward, we will stop using 2019 as a benchmark, I would say except for our outbound travel segment.  With regard to the recent performance, let me starting with the market performance. The China travel market has shown strong momentum, quarter-to-date, especially during the Chinese New Year. Number of domestic tourists grow by 34% year-over-year, or 19% above the 2019 level. And outbound travel continues to recover with flight capacity during the Chinese New Year holiday, reaching around 70% of the 2019 level. And we are very happy to see that the several -- see that several countries have not offering Visa free entry for Chinese travelers.  With regard to our own performance, our company continues to outpace the market growth, solidify our position and gaining a significant market share. During the recent Chinese New Year holiday, our domestic hotel and air reservations have increased by more than 60% and 50% year-over-year respectively. And our outbound hotel and air reservation have both surpassed the 2019 level.  At January of 2023, including the Chinese New Year holiday was a low base for travel activities and the travel momentum only started to pick up after the Chinese New Year. Therefore, we anticipate stronger year-over-year growth in the first half of Q1 this year and followed by a comparatively softer second half just because of the [indiscernible]. And with regard to the international market, our Trip.com business has maintained a mid to high double digit year-over-year growth. Therefore, we continuously to see a very strong growth in the travel market. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will come from Alex Yao from JP Morgan, your line is open. \nAlex Yao : Thank you, management, for taking my question. So the Civil Aviation Administration of China, I see, it has projected that the outbound flight capacity will reach 80% of pre COVID levels by the end of 2024. This seems relatively slow considering the capacity has already reached 70% during the Chinese New Year holiday. From your perspective, what factors might contribute to this slow recovery? When does management anticipate a full recovery in the outbound travel sector? Thank you.\nJane Sun: Thank you, Alex. We hold a very strong confidence in the full recovery of outbound travel. Firstly, our platform has observed a significant surge interest in the outbound travel, which indicates a robust demand for our users. Furthermore, China is becoming increasingly open to attract inbound tourism, which forms a part of the demand for travel related international travel.  Secondly, the market supplier situation is improving, we have noticed a steady recovery in the number of inbound and outbound flights. Additionally, visa policy has become increasingly favorable. For instance, we observed that the markets offering visa free policies to Chinese travelers showed much better recovery during the Chinese New Year period, compared to other destinations.  Lastly, it&#x27;s important to know that the most markets outside of China, are project to require two to three years to fully recover their international travel. Even the 70% to 80% recovery of outbound passenger volume in 2024, will indicate a year-over-year growth of approximately 65% to 90%. This clearly illustrates the potential for the strong growth in outbound travel in the coming year. And with our own data, during the recent Chinese New Year holiday, our group already saw our air and hotel reservations fully bounced back and beyond the 2019 level. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Jiong Shao from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJiong Shao : Thank you very much for taking my question. And firstly, Happy New Year to you all. \nJane Sun: Thank you. \nJiong Shao: Yeah. So there are a lot of cross currency in the Chinese economy today, as you know, I mean, the property market, the stock market are doing terribly. People&#x27;s confidence is very low. Economy is kind of soft. You have put up very, very strong results and congrats on that. I was just wondering, in Q4, and so far in Q1, what have you seen in terms your travelers spending behavior, leisure travel, or business travel, are they spending less, spending the same? Or in terms of changes in destination? Anything you can share will be great.\nJane Sun: Thank you for your question. China is a very big country, there are a lot of different segments. We have seen that certain segments, such as entertainment, music festivals, wellness, and travel, these segments are doing very well. We have seen customers have increased their travel demand based on our search volume on our platform. Many customers are going to different places, both domestically and to the rest of the world.  The interests for our customers to explore different regions in the world has been enhanced compared to pre-COVID level. With the easiness of travel restrictions, and also gradual recovery for the visa applications and flight capacity, we&#x27;re hoping 2024 will be the year that we can take more customers to travel within China and to the rest of the world. So the travel demand is very strong and we are very committed to provide the best service and products to our customers. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Simon Cheung from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nSimon Cheung : Hi, happy new year everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just have one quick question in relation to the margins. I think if you look in the prior several years, on a sequential basis, obviously fourth quarter seasonally weaker, we see some solid margin contraction and we have seen that as well in your fourth quarter result. However, I think the magnitude of correction like when I look at quarter-on-quarter the EBIT margins fallen by roughly about 6% to 7% compared to historically, maybe almost like mid-teens. It&#x27;s seemingly attracting a bit better than anticipated.  So I guess the question I have is, we have seen quite a few quarters of sales and marketing expenses, tracking well below the 2019 level. And I just wanted to question how you&#x27;re thinking about the trend, especially given incrementally there might be more spending to be incurred, maybe in the oversea market, now that you have a more aggressive globalization strategy. Thank you.\nJane Sun: Thank you, Simon. With regard to the sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter, last year, we have seen a significant improvement in our marketing efficiencies, primarily due to our enhanced conversion, as well as the internal cross selling initiatives. And on top of that, we also make a lot of investment in for example, the content generation, which also significantly help us to improve the marketing efficiency.  And our long term goal is to further enhance the marketing efficiencies in both the China as well as our international market by focusing on increasing our direct traffic -- increasing our direct traffic, as well as to improving our cross selling within our platform. But of course, that in the -- for the International Trip.com business, we are also looking at the opportunity to further enhance our brand awareness outside of China market. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will come from the line of Brian Gong from Citi. Your line is open.\nBrian Gong : Good morning, James, Jane, Cindy and Michelle, Happy New Year. And thanks for taking my question. My question is also regarding our international platform trip.com, which has recorded strong growth. Could you provide a bit more details of Trip.com\u2019s, like global footprint, GMV and the revenue contribution as well as profitability? Also, what our primary markets that Trip.com focus on and what our Trip.com\u2019s key competitive advantages in those markets versus its competitors? Thank you.\nJane Sun: Thank you.

                    Thank you, Michelle. And thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. China&#x27;s border reopening in 2003 has ignited a global travel search. Our enhanced leadership in product and service has empowered us to significantly outperform the market. In 2023, our total OTA business reached a record high achieving a GMV of approximately RMB1.1 trillion or USD $160 billion [ph].  This marks the year-over-year increase of 130% and growth about 30% compared to 2019. Currently, our total net revenue also grew by 122% year-over-year, and a 25% compared to 2019. We significantly improved our adjusted EBITDA margin to 31% in 2023, which is the highest level over the past decade. In September 2023 we begin buying back our own stock using the existing quota. Additionally, the Board has approved the 2024 capital return program, further increasing our overall quota to a total of USD $581 million. This decision demonstrates our strong confidence in the long term value potential of the company.  The China town market has been growing significantly, with outbound travel playing an increasingly large role due to easier visa access and the gradual resumption of international flights.  Our global business is also thriving, particularly in the APAC region, reflecting a strengthened market presence and improve the product competitiveness. Expanding our international operations with diversified products worldwide remains a key priority for us. As travel demand rises, we also recognized the increasing importance of enhancing our service. Through exceptional customer service, AI technology and the reliable content, we continue to invest in improving user experience. Our commitment to globalization and great quality collectively now as our digital strategy drives us to continuously innovate and improve.  The year 2023 mark the China&#x27;s reopening to the world, and 2024 will be a year of consolidating and expanding global tourism. I&#x27;m holding our digital strategy we aim to become a leading player in Asia market and a global market in a three to five years.  With that I&#x27;ll turn the call over to Jane, for operational highlights.

                <div class="p-4">
                    Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone. As a quick overview, our net revenue in Q4 grew by 104% year-over-year and increased by 24% compared to 2019. During this period, the travel industry witnessed a strong momentum. As rising travel sentiment drove growth and supply side constraints continued to ease. Both, our hotel and air reservations grew by approximately 130% year-over-year. For the full year of 2023, our total net revenue achieved year-over-year growth of 122% and 25% compared to 2019. This outstanding result was due to the robust release of travel demand and the exceptional performance across all of our business segments.  Additionally, our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2023 significantly improved to 31%, reflecting the successful optimization of our cost structure and overall productivity enhancement.  Now let me walk you through different market performance. First, China Domestic. In Q4, the China domestic market continued to exhibit robust growth. Our domestic hotel bookings witnessed a year-over-year growth of over 130% or more than 60% compared to 2019.  Demand for travel showed no signs of slowing down during the winter season. Popular destinations such as Harbin in the northern part of the country, experienced a surge in visitors. Notably, individuals have been prioritizing travel expenditures over other daily expenses, indicating a shift towards experiential spending. This change in consumer behavior has significantly favored travel industry as more people allocate their resources towards exploring new places and creating memorable experiences.  We have continued to expand our user base among the elderly demographics through the deep integration of product integration, content generation and marketing efforts. In Q4, the number of the users over 50 years old, increased by more than 90% compared to 2019. And this is just a beginning to capitalize on the market opportunity for retired community, which has been in power and ample time.  Second, outbound market. Despite the winter seasonality in Q4, outbound travel from China, maintain the same level of the recovery as the peak season in Q3. The gradual easing of supply side constraints, such as increased international flight capacity, and certain clearance of the Visa block, played a significant role in facilitating this positive trend. Chinese travelers continue to exhibit high demand for travel to overseas destinations. Moreover, many countries implemented visa free policies, specifically targeting at Chinese travelers, further enhancing the appeal of these destinations and securing their popularities.  In Q4, Trip.com Group’s outbound air ticket and hotel bookings recovered to more than 80% of pre-pandemic level, surpassing the market overall recovery rate of 60%. Thailand, Singapore, Japan, Korea, Malaysia remain as the top outbound travel destination on our platform.  Third, global markets. On the international front, we actively enhance our global market presence. Through the strong synergy of improved products, enhance the services and targeted marketing efforts, we have witnessed a steady growth in APAC region. In Q4, total GMV of our overseas OTA brand grew by more than 70% year-over-year, and increased by more than one 100% compared to 2019.  Now, let me walk you through a few strategic highlights. First, globalization. As 2023 was about a return to travel, then 2024 will be the year when people go further than ever before. The travelers become more comfortable and confident then touring around the world. They are taking to the skies, rails, roads and the seas to experience unforgettable adventures. From music festivals to exotic adventures, travelers are increasingly seeking more than just a typical gateway. They are craving for immersive cultural experiences thrilling adventures, and the music, euphoria. All value a meaningful connections and quality time with their families and friends.  In light of this evolving travel preference, Trip.com Group is providing comprehensive travel information and insights as well as expanding our global offering in products and services. Recognizing that the total addressable market in the major Asia regions is larger than that of China. Our goal is to further extend our business skills by establishing ourselves as the leading player in Asian market and global market with the next three to five years.  Our global OTA platform currently operates in 39 countries and regions across Asia, Europe, and the rest of the world. We offer users a wide range of travel options through our one stop model. With our exceptional 24/7 multilingual in-house customer service, and global SOS support, our global users can receive immediate assistance through our AI Chatbot, or connect with live representatives within an average time of 30 seconds only.  Over 60% of our global bookings are made directly through Trip.com. We have been successful in gaining mindshare and market share in the key Asia regions, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, Japan, Thailand and Malaysia. Second, inbound markets. China inbound travel is an untapped opportunity. Inbound tourism plays a vital role in country&#x27;s economy.  For tourism dependent countries, such as Thailand, inbound travel can contribute to more than 10% of its GDP. For developed nation, inbound travel can contribute to around 1% to 3% of its GDP. China&#x27;s current level is less than 0.5%. If China can reach a global average, between 1% to 2%, it would unlock a great market potential of another RMB1.5 trillion to RMB2 trillion market.  Recognizing the importance of inbound travel, China has included its integral part of its 14th five-year plan. The government has taken steps to facilitate inbound tourism by granting visa free access, making travel more convenient for international visitors. China has extended its visa free policies to citizens from 10 countries so far, including France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, Switzerland, Singapore, and Malaysia and Thailand. Since the implementation of this visa free policy, there have been a remarkable increase in inbound travel to China from these countries, with a rising of nearly 30% in December when compared to November, as reported by Chinese National Immigration administration.  In 2023, Trip.com, has already observed a significant surge in visitor numbers, with a four-digit increase compared to 2022. Moreover, government is making progress in many areas, such as simplifying visa application process, facilitating foreign credit card payments, and enabling online travel reservations with foreign passports. We anticipate that the forthcoming inbound tourism policy will bring about favorable changes, creating new opportunities for the industry.

                    Thank you, Alex. As of 2023, our business has fully rebounded to pre-COVID levels. From this year forward, we will stop using 2019 as a benchmark, I would say except for our outbound travel segment.  With regard to the recent performance, let me starting with the market performance. The China travel market has shown strong momentum, quarter-to-date, especially during the Chinese New Year. Number of domestic tourists grow by 34% year-over-year, or 19% above the 2019 level. And outbound travel continues to recover with flight capacity during the Chinese New Year holiday, reaching around 70% of the 2019 level. And we are very happy to see that the several -- see that several countries have not offering Visa free entry for Chinese travelers.  With regard to our own performance, our company continues to outpace the market growth, solidify our position and gaining a significant market share. During the recent Chinese New Year holiday, our domestic hotel and air reservations have increased by more than 60% and 50% year-over-year respectively. And our outbound hotel and air reservation have both surpassed the 2019 level.  At January of 2023, including the Chinese New Year holiday was a low base for travel activities and the travel momentum only started to pick up after the Chinese New Year. Therefore, we anticipate stronger year-over-year growth in the first half of Q1 this year and followed by a comparatively softer second half just because of the [indiscernible]. And with regard to the international market, our Trip.com business has maintained a mid to high double digit year-over-year growth. Therefore, we continuously to see a very strong growth in the travel market. Thank you.

                    Thank you, management, for taking my question. So the Civil Aviation Administration of China, I see, it has projected that the outbound flight capacity will reach 80% of pre COVID levels by the end of 2024. This seems relatively slow considering the capacity has already reached 70% during the Chinese New Year holiday. From your perspective, what factors might contribute to this slow recovery? When does management anticipate a full recovery in the outbound travel sector? Thank you.

                    Thank you, Alex. We hold a very strong confidence in the full recovery of outbound travel. Firstly, our platform has observed a significant surge interest in the outbound travel, which indicates a robust demand for our users. Furthermore, China is becoming increasingly open to attract inbound tourism, which forms a part of the demand for travel related international travel.  Secondly, the market supplier situation is improving, we have noticed a steady recovery in the number of inbound and outbound flights. Additionally, visa policy has become increasingly favorable. For instance, we observed that the markets offering visa free policies to Chinese travelers showed much better recovery during the Chinese New Year period, compared to other destinations.  Lastly, it&#x27;s important to know that the most markets outside of China, are project to require two to three years to fully recover their international travel. Even the 70% to 80% recovery of outbound passenger volume in 2024, will indicate a year-over-year growth of approximately 65% to 90%. This clearly illustrates the potential for the strong growth in outbound travel in the coming year. And with our own data, during the recent Chinese New Year holiday, our group already saw our air and hotel reservations fully bounced back and beyond the 2019 level. Thank you.

                    Yeah. So there are a lot of cross currency in the Chinese economy today, as you know, I mean, the property market, the stock market are doing terribly. People&#x27;s confidence is very low. Economy is kind of soft. You have put up very, very strong results and congrats on that. I was just wondering, in Q4, and so far in Q1, what have you seen in terms your travelers spending behavior, leisure travel, or business travel, are they spending less, spending the same? Or in terms of changes in destination? Anything you can share will be great.

                    Thank you for your question. China is a very big country, there are a lot of different segments. We have seen that certain segments, such as entertainment, music festivals, wellness, and travel, these segments are doing very well. We have seen customers have increased their travel demand based on our search volume on our platform. Many customers are going to different places, both domestically and to the rest of the world.  The interests for our customers to explore different regions in the world has been enhanced compared to pre-COVID level. With the easiness of travel restrictions, and also gradual recovery for the visa applications and flight capacity, we&#x27;re hoping 2024 will be the year that we can take more customers to travel within China and to the rest of the world. So the travel demand is very strong and we are very committed to provide the best service and products to our customers. Thank you.

                    Hi, happy new year everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just have one quick question in relation to the margins. I think if you look in the prior several years, on a sequential basis, obviously fourth quarter seasonally weaker, we see some solid margin contraction and we have seen that as well in your fourth quarter result. However, I think the magnitude of correction like when I look at quarter-on-quarter the EBIT margins fallen by roughly about 6% to 7% compared to historically, maybe almost like mid-teens. It&#x27;s seemingly attracting a bit better than anticipated.  So I guess the question I have is, we have seen quite a few quarters of sales and marketing expenses, tracking well below the 2019 level. And I just wanted to question how you&#x27;re thinking about the trend, especially given incrementally there might be more spending to be incurred, maybe in the oversea market, now that you have a more aggressive globalization strategy. Thank you.

                    Thank you, Simon. With regard to the sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter, last year, we have seen a significant improvement in our marketing efficiencies, primarily due to our enhanced conversion, as well as the internal cross selling initiatives. And on top of that, we also make a lot of investment in for example, the content generation, which also significantly help us to improve the marketing efficiency.  And our long term goal is to further enhance the marketing efficiencies in both the China as well as our international market by focusing on increasing our direct traffic -- increasing our direct traffic, as well as to improving our cross selling within our platform. But of course, that in the -- for the International Trip.com business, we are also looking at the opportunity to further enhance our brand awareness outside of China market. Thank you.

                    Thank you. We anticipate at the Trip.com will contribute 15% to 20% of the group&#x27;s total revenue over the next two or three to five years, with the mid to high double digit CAGR growth. And we believe that the Trip.com growth is built upon our robust product logistics, supply chain service standard, as well as the technologies that we applied across various to our specific core regions. Our Trip.com, primarily focusing on the Asian market, which is the top outbound destinations for travelers from both China and other parts within the region. It&#x27;s worth noting that the combined size of the top Asia market, excluding China surpasses that of the mainland China in terms of the growth bookings.  Our growth strategy with Trip.com starts with leveraging the strong air traffic from Skyscanner, and then progresses from many search to the mobile app, broadening our offering from air travel to the hotel bookings extends our reach from Asia, hopefully to the rest of the global travel. Meanwhile, and we anticipate that the Trip.com were to be profitable within the same time frame. This will be driven by the scalability, increase the marketing efficiencies through a strong mobile presence and brand name as well as the shift in the revenue mix favorably hotel bookings.  With regard to the competitive advantage off our Trip.com platform, I think firstly, Trip.com’s mobile app offers a smooth and user friendly search and booking experience.
