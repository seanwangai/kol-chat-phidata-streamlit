Our outbound hotel and air ticket bookings recovered to 120% compared with 2019 levels, continuing to outperform the industry by 40%. Japan remains the top destination for Chinese outbound travelers closely followed by other APAC regions. Additionally, there is a growing interest in long-haul destinations, such as Europe, the Americas, Oceania and the Middle East. Notably, citizens from higher-tier cities are eager to expand their travel radius and explore more distant destinations while those from lower-tier cities are beginning to venture beyond national borders and emerging as a new growth driver in outbound travel. During the National Day holiday travel bookings from Tier 4 and 5 cities surged by 100% and 300%, respectively. In the domestic Chinese market, travel demand remains robust with travel pattern more evenly distributed across the country. It is encouraging to see travelers increasingly exploring inland and lesser-known destinations contributing to the further development of local tourism.

In Q3, inbound hotel bookings on our platform increasing by around 100%, reflecting a heightened interest in travel China among global travelers.

They also show a preference of customized trips over traditional group tours usually with the theme of natural site seeing and cruise vacations seeking flexible, relaxing, and enjoyable experiences.

Congratulations on the solid results. My question is could you please provide some insight into your recent performance following the National Day holiday? Additionally, what should investors expect for 2025?

----------------------------------------

[Cindy Wang]
Thank you. After the National Day holiday, we observed that the China travel market is generally the normal seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, the overall momentum has further strengthened. Industry data shows that what your occupancy rates over the past months have surpassed the last year's level, improving from the lower than 2023 levels in Q3. This is partly due to a comparatively easier comp base and more travelers choosing to travel during off-peak seasons. At Trip.com Group, we continue to maintain a growth rate that surpasses the industry average. The outbound flight and hotel bookings also maintained very strong year-over-year growth momentum, exceeding 120% of the same period in 2019. And Trip.com's flight and hotel bookings continue to maintain a mid- to high double-digit growth. With regard to the colors for the next year, it's actually very challenging for us to make an accurate estimate for the year to come, but we anticipate normalized growth pattern for our China-related business with continued emphasizes on the inbound and outbound cross-border travel.

Congrats on a very solid quarter. I wanted to follow up on our Trip.com's global business. So, could management maybe allow your strategy in Asia? How do we plan to gain market share further given this is a vast market opportunity and potentially we're going to see maybe increasing investments from international peers?

----------------------------------------

[Jane Sun]
Yes, Asia is a very important market for us. It represents 50% of the GDP growth. It also represents 50% of the growth for the travel industry.

This is Wei calling for James Lee. Just one on your AI initiative, right? Could management help elaborate on AI kind of initiative and maybe share more on your operating highlights, if possible?

----------------------------------------

[Jane Sun]
Sure. We invest heavily in our technology and AI. Many engineers are working very hard to make sure AI support our operations. There are four main usage on our platform. The first one is AI is helping us to improve the user's experience, in the past, customers need to use search to find the right product for their needs. Right now, we use AI, we can use a very smooth competition with our system and our system will promote the right product that is suitable for our customers based on their travel habit. The second thing is using AI, our engineers will be able to cut the coding time anywhere between 15% to 30%. Firstly, we also used AI to improve our customer service level to make sure we provide the excellent services to our customers. The last one is content generation.

[Operator]
Our next question comes from the line of Jiong Shao from Barclays.

----------------------------------------

[Jiong Shao]
Jane, I just want to follow up on what you just said. I think you highlighted some of the operational benefits from AI. I was wondering if you can expand a bit beyond that to talk about perhaps when it comes to the $1.10 on the financial impact, both for the short term and for the long term from AI?

----------------------------------------

[Jane Sun]
Yes. So, AI -- go ahead, Cindy.

----------------------------------------

[Cindy Wang]
Sure. We have consistently integrated our new technologies into our operations and progressing from the mobile technology to non-generative AI and now to the generative AI. And the financial impact, all the investment so far has been a minimum compared with our financial, especially the top line as well as the bottom line. And quantify the financial benefits of the new technology at this moment is still quite challenged. However, from operational perspective, AI definitely can improve our user engagement and conversion rates, as Jane explained, and at the same time, which will also enhance significantly on the service efficiencies and boost our internal operational efficiency. These improvements will eventually be reflected in our financial performance. Thank you.

----------------------------------------

[Operator]
Our next question comes from the line of Parash Jain from HSBC.

----------------------------------------

[Parash Jain]
I have two questions. First, so now, in a post-COVID world, the group has taken a lift frog in terms of setting the standard with respect to operating margin performance. Now consistently generating a huge amount of free cash flow, if you can give us some color with respect to your uses of capital, are you seeing enough M&A opportunities or it is about time where we come full year, we hear more on what will be the potential uses of those capital, whether it is from a dividend or a buyback? And my second question is, now in terms of the GMV, you are at a scale, how shall we think about the operating lever in terms of your product and marketing costs going forward? Is there a feeling or pretty much quarter-by-quarter, you will keep surprising us?

----------------------------------------

[Cindy Wang]
Sure. Thank you. Yes, we generated a lot of free cash flow. But in terms of the use of capital, of course, we -- as a leader in the travel sector, we will continue to look at different opportunities in the market. However, we think at the moment, we already have a very, very important asset, travel assets in the whole international market. And at this moment, our top priority is to maximize the synergies among of our different brands in the international market. And with regard to the capital return policies, year-to-date, we have already repurchased approximately 6 million shares or approximately 1% of our outstanding shares. The scale of our future capital return will depend on our financial conditions, operational results cash flow, capital needs and other relevant factors. And we anticipate an expanded capital return program for the year to come 2025 and potentially will include a mix of dividends and buyback, but also subject to our Board approval. And the second question is about the margin rate?

----------------------------------------

[Parash Jain]
Yes. I mean how much operating leverage do you have?

----------------------------------------

[Cindy Wang]
Yes. We -- first of all, OTA is a very scalable business model. As you may know this already in the past couple of years after the -- in the past two years, after the COVID, we already achieved a very efficient operational efficiencies across all the expenses line, including the cost -- the product development as well as the sales and marketing expenses. But sales and the marketing expenses as a percentage of our gross bookings actually were less than 1% and benefiting from our very high customer royalty and strong cross-selling ratio through our mobile app. And we anticipate our marketing expenses ratio will actually increase in the Q4, especially compared with our net revenues due to seasonality and fluctuations in the revenue mix between our China and international businesses. And in the longer-term period, we aim to enhance our marketing efficiencies across all markets by prioritized direct mobile app traffic and cross-selling. But again, we are continuously to increase our efficiencies across all the expenses line item, especially after introduce AI to help us to increase the efficiencies. But at the same time, we need to investment especially in the international market. Thank you.
